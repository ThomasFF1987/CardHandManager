This project is based on the desire to reproduce trading card game features like here, having a hand of cards to play in your game.

I aim to develop a package easy to use for game developers where you can provide a list of cards (like a deck) to the CardHandManager and it will feature your cards in a way on your screen that match your game and the real life feeling of holding cards at a game table.

I hope, you will enjoyed it and feel free to ask for features or modifications.

It's currently a WIP project.
