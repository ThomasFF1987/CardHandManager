Developed by Thomas Baggi-Sani, in Unity 6.3 LTS (6000.3.5f2)

[Description]

This project is based on the desire to reproduce trading card game features like having a hand of cards to play in your game.

I aim to develop a package easy to use for game developers where you can provide a list of cards (like a deck) to the CardHandManager and it will feature your cards in a way on your screen that match your game and the real life feeling of holding cards at a game table.

I hope, you will enjoyed it and feel free to ask for features or modifications.

It's currently a WIP project.

[How it works]

1-Download the .unitypackage file in this repo.
2-Import this package in a new unity project or your game project.
3-Open the MainScene.scene in Unity.
4-Press Play to run the application.
5-Press G on your keyboard to generate a hand of cards.
6-You can drag and drop cards and see what CardHandManager can do in realtime.
7-You can create Cards and Decks configuration using Scriptable Objects.
